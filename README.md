Price Prediction for Houses Using Linear Regression This project aims to develop a linear regression model that predicts the cost of homes based on their primary characteristics, such as the number of rooms, the number of bathrooms, and the surface area (in square feet). This model's goal is to investigate the relationship between these explanatory factors and housing costs while providing precise estimates based on the information supplied.
